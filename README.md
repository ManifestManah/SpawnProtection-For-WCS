# [WC:S Reignited] Spawn Protection System

## About
When adding this plugin to your Warcraft-Source server players will be immune to all sources of damage for the first 7 seconds of each round, or alternatively every time they respawn if you choose to enable this feature. Unlike other spawn protections, this one will not color the player while he is protected, unless you choose to enable this feature. 
In addition this spawn protection will remove your own spawn protection if you; scope with a weapon, fire a weapon, left or right click while holding a knife, or if you press either your ability or ultimate button.

Note: 
All of the features above are easily configurable and can be adjusted to your liking in the autogenerated configuration file.
